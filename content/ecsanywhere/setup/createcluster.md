1. Run the following command to create a ECS cluster

    ```bash
    # Create ECS Cluster
    aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME
    ```

2. Below command will create an ECS-anywhere activation key and write it to `ssm-activation.json` in your current working directory

    ```bash
    # Create activation Key
    aws ssm create-activation --iam-role $ROLE_NAME | tee ssm-activation.json
    ```

3. Run the following command to verify the generated activation

    ```bash
    cat ssm-activation.json
    ```

    ```json
    {
        "ActivationId": "<<ACTIVATIONID>>",
        "ActivationCode": "<<ACTIVATIONCODE>>"
    }
    ```

    > Note: This activation key will help to associate the virtual machine to ECS control plane
